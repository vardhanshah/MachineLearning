Here, it is implementation of naive bayes algorithm with assumption of gaussian distribution
in python3.

Above implementation will take dataset as input and will train itself, As for the
prediction part, You can give another input file, otherwise it will use input dataset to predict
result and comparing it with original result.

both files should contain features, followed by original outcome.

file should contain data set as :
        
        feature 1,feature 2,[feature 3,...,],outcome
in this manner.

As the execution part, matplotlib module will be needed,if not available you can use other source code
file, both source code file has same structure, but one file uses matplotlib to plot graph and other don't
use it.

for example:

    execute any .py file and give input 

    iris.data 4
